# Links to my Sandia work

My Sandia report is approved for UUR, so I wanted to make it available here until it's on OSTI.gov.

Click **here** to view the Technical Sandia Report

Click **here** to view my research poster, which I presented at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico

Once my report is sent to the Office of Science and Technical Information, you can find it by searching "SAND2024-15407" on [OSTI.gov](https://www.osti.gov)

Thanks for tuning in :D
