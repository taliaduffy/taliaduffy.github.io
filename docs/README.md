# Links to my Sandia work

My Sandia report is approved for Unclassified Unlimited Release (UUR), so I wanted to make it available here.

Click **[here](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2480118/)** to view the Technical Sandia Report I wrote about my research project.

Click **[here](https://taliaduffy.github.io/sandia_files/research_poster.pdf)** to view my research poster, which I presented at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

The report can also be found directly with the Department of Energy's Office of Science and Technical Information by searching "SAND2024-15407" on [OSTI.gov](https://www.osti.gov).

Thanks for tuning in :D
