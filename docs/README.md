# Links to my Sandia work

My Sandia report is approved for Unclassified Unlimited Release (UUR), so I wanted to make it available here until it's on OSTI.gov.

Click [here](https://taliaduffy.github.io/sandia_files/sandia_report_2415407.pdf) to view the Technical Sandia Report I wrote about my research project.

Click [here](https://taliaduffy.github.io/sandia_files/research_poster.pdf) to view my research poster, which I presented at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Once the report is sent to the Office of Science and Technical Information, you can find it by searching "SAND2024-15407" on [OSTI.gov](https://www.osti.gov)

Thanks for tuning in :D
