# Links to my Sandia work

Some of my work at Sandia National Labs has been approved for UUR, so I wanted to make it available here.

Click **[here](https://taliaduffy.github.io/sandia_files/sandia_report_2616541.pdf)** to view the chapter I wrote for an internal handbook on minimum sample size reliability testing. My section covers manufacturing controls methods for high-consequence, single-use systems. 

Click **[here](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/2480118/)** to view the Technical Sandia Report based on my first project, which implements sensitivity analysis methods for set-based concurrent engineering data.
- You can also find this one by searching "SAND2024-15407" on [OSTI.gov](https://www.osti.gov)

Click **[here](https://taliaduffy.github.io/sandia_files/research_poster.pdf)** to view my research poster from the same project, which I presented at the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History in Albuquerque, New Mexico in August 2024.


Thanks for tuning in :D
